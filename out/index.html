<figure><img src="figures/textflix-screenshot.png" alt="The Textflix prototype"><figcaption><a href="https://textflix.fastforwardlabs.com" target="_blank">The Textflix prototype</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of transfer learning is that it is so broadly
applicable. It does not enable one specific capability, like question answering,
language translation, text classification, or search. It makes <em>each</em> of these
more accurate, at a lower cost, with less data, and thus more accessible to a
broader community. It opens the pathway from research to production.</p>
<p>We built a prototype, <a href="https://textflix.fastforwardlabs.com" target="_blank">Textflix</a>, that leverages transfer learning for sentiment
analysis. Textflix performs positive or negative sentiment detection on movie
reviews, which present a challenge to text processing systems because of the
complex ways in which humans express their preferences. We added LIME, an
interpretability technique,
to provide insight into the
model’s predictions and used this mechanism to provide individual summaries of
each movie. The entire product was built using a model trained on just 500
labeled examples. The modeling was implemented with off-the-shelf tools from
AllenNLP and did not require writing any code. Everything was completed within
an infrastructure budget of $25.</p>
<h2 id="sentiment">Sentiment</h2>
<p>While transfer learning is likely to be beneficial for almost any NLP
application, some will benefit more than others. Even though transfer learning
can be implemented at low cost, we do not recommend using a sophisticated deep
learning model for a 1% gain in accuracy. Some applications, like basic topic
categorization, can be handled admirably by extremely simple statistical models
(like Naive Bayes, which is essentially counting words). In such cases, sticking
with the simple model works best.</p>
<p>But sentiment detection – the task of inferring how the writer or speaker feels
– requires sophisticated tools. When humans convey their feelings, they may use
sarcasm and irony. They might incorporate obscure pop culture references. They
might have mixed feelings, contradict themselves, or even change their minds by
the time they’ve finished their thoughts! Without transfer learning, all of
these difficult challenges would need to be solved by learning from a single,
possibly small, dataset. Because of these difficulties, sentiment detection
demonstrates very clearly the power of transfer learning.</p>
<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>Textflix is built on the IMDB dataset, a popular open dataset commonly used for
sentiment analysis. The dataset consists of 25,000 movie reviews from the users
of the popular online movie database, although only 500 of those were used to
build the model behind Textflix, as a demonstration of the power of transfer
learning.</p>
<p>While sentiment analysis can be applied in many different domains, movie reviews
are interesting because they present a diverse set of challenges. Many of the
reviews are straightforward and simple, but some contain subtle clues as to the
author’s opinion. These subtleties are challenging for machine learning models
– a model based on simple statistics will not work well. Because the reviews
are written in rather plain English (no specialized dialects or slang), publicly
available pretrained models (which were trained on generic English) will work
well.</p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<p>The modeling process for Textflix was extremely simple. One of the great
benefits of transfer learning is that it eliminates the need to invent complex
new neural network architectures that uniquely solve a particular problem.
Off-the-shelf transfer learning models already provide state-of-the-art
accuracy, so the fewer changes we make, the better. After comparing several
models, we ended up using the large version of the BERT model.</p>
<p>We experimented with several popular transfer learning models, and also compared
their performance to simple but strong baseline methods. Although we built
Textflix with a model trained on only 500 examples, for each model we explored
its performance curve when training on more labeled examples. In the following
sections we present these results and justify our modeling choices.</p>
<h3 id="baseline-models">Baseline Models</h3>
<p>Testing baseline methods is an important first step in the modeling process.
Even if they are unlikely to yield a usable model, they are easy to implement,
present a logical reference for comparing future models to, and are usually more
interpretable than more sophisticated alternatives. In some cases, the
simplicity and interpretability advantages they present may outweigh the
decrease in accuracy in the results they produce. For our prototype, we explored
two baselines: <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P12/P12-2018/" target="_blank">SVM with Naive Bayes features</a> and word vectors.</p>
<h4 id="nb-svm">NB-SVM</h4>
<p>For text classification problems like sentiment analysis it makes sense to
choose a simple model based on bag-of-words as the first baseline. In many text
classification problems, like topic classification, these types of baseline
models may even be the best choice. NB-SVM treats the text as a bag of words and
combines a Naive Bayes model (also a reasonable baseline) with a support vector
machine. This model has been shown to produce strong linear baselines for text
classification, and sentiment analysis in particular.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/fig-22.png" alt="Pipeline architecture for the NB-SVM model."><figcaption>Pipeline architecture for the NB-SVM model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In testing this model we generated both uni- and bigram features for the NB-SVM
classifier, removed stopwords from the input, and used a <a href="https://snowballstem.org/" target="_blank">Snowball stemmer</a> to normalize each word.</p>
<p>The performance of the NB-SVM was poor and unpredictable at low dataset sizes –
it simply did not have enough observations to learn which words strongly
correlated with positive or negative sentiment. However, at larger training set
sizes (e.g., 10,000 examples), this baseline reached a useful accuracy of about
85% with very little tuning.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/figure-nbsvm-graph.png" alt="NB-SVM is no better than guessing at training set sizes less than 200."><figcaption>NB-SVM is no better than guessing at training set sizes less than 200.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This performance curve shows that even simple bag-of-words models can identify a
large majority of sentiment examples correctly. And because the NB-SVM model is
simple and fast to implement, it would be easier to support in a production use
case than some deep neural network models.</p>
<h4 id="word-vectors">Word Vectors</h4>
<p>As we’ve seen, the NB-SVM model cannot be reasonably expected to perform well
with small training datasets. Because it is a bag-of-words model, it has no a
priori knowledge of words and their associations and must learn everything from
the training data. A model that leverages word vectors should do better in the
small-data regime, since word vectors are a form of transfer learning. That is,
the meaning of words is already captured in the pretrained word vectors, and is
not affected by the small data size.</p>
<p>We used the following simple architecture for this model.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/fig-23.png" alt="Pipeline architecture for the word vectors model."><figcaption>Pipeline architecture for the word vectors model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The performance curve shows that the word vectors model generally follows the
same trend as the NB-SVM baseline. (It is important to note that there is a lot
of variance at each data point, which is not shown in the plot, so small
differences should be taken lightly.)</p>
<figure><img src="figures/figure-graph-2.png" alt="Transferred word vectors suffer from the same problems as the NB-SVM model."><figcaption>Transferred word vectors suffer from the same problems as the NB-SVM model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This result is, in some ways, surprising since word vectors are a form of
transfer learning and should therefore be more resilient to limited data than
the baseline NB-SVM model. It is likely that the word vectors model could be
tuned to outperform NB-SVM at smaller training sizes by adjusting the
hyperparameters and architecture. However, we purposely spent little time
optimizing hyperparameters with any of the models. The hyperparameter
optimization step is largely a heuristic process and can require deep expertise
to guide the search – something we wanted to avoid.</p>
<h3 id="transfer-learning-models">Transfer Learning Models</h3>
<p>With well-performing baselines established, we began to try out several of the
publicly available transfer learning models. We experimented with ULMFiT using
the Fast.AI library and found it to perform well, even with limited data. We
performed language-model fine-tuning using 50,000 unlabeled examples for the
ULMFiT model, and then performed supervised training at various dataset sizes.
In addition to ULMFiT, we ran experiments for both the BERT-Base and BERT-Large
models, using the AllenNLP library.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/figure-graph-3.png" alt="New transfer learning models can perform well even with fewer than 100 examples."><figcaption>New transfer learning models can perform well even with fewer than 100 examples.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The best-performing models were the BERT-Large and ULMFiT models. While these
models produced nearly equal results, we found that the BERT-Large model was
easier to implement and experiment with. This is in part because no language
model fine-tuning step was required with BERT-Large (target task fine-tuning,
however, was performed for each model), and in part because ULMFiT is trained
via the Fast.AI library, which imposes development via notebooks – something we
find to be restrictive.</p>
<p>We trained the BERT-Large model without making any custom modifications and
defined the entire experiment in a JSON configuration file in the AllenNLP
style. We trained on a single GPU for 20 epochs, using an Adam optimizer, and
used gradual unfreezing for fine-tuning the layers of the model.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/fig-32.png" alt="Pipeline architecture for the BERT-large model"><figcaption>Pipeline architecture for the BERT-large model</figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, we did very little tuning of the model’s hyperparameters. This limited
tuning requirement is one of the greatest benefits of transfer learning: the
out-of-the-box performance is already very good, and eking out a further 1-2% of
accuracy has diminishing returns and would require expensive-to-acquire
knowledge of the model architecture.</p>
<p>The final BERT model provides accuracy roughly equivalent to the
state-of-the-art model, using just 500 labeled examples for training.</p>
<h2 id="interpretability">Interpretability</h2>
<p>A cost of using transfer learning is the less interpretable, black box nature of neural network models. The ability to detect
sentiment is undeniably useful, but the ability to explain those predictions is
significantly more powerful. With interpretability, we can not only classify
the user’s sentiment but point to specific evidence to support that
classification. We found the addition of interpretability to the model’s
predictions to be surprisingly useful. Here we will discuss our approach and
some of the benefits.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/rockstar-review.png" alt="Predicting sentiment is useful, but pointing readers to specific evidence that the model relies on allows the reader to trust the prediction."><figcaption>Predicting sentiment is useful, but pointing readers to specific evidence that the model relies on allows the reader to trust the prediction.</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="modified-lime-for-sequences">Modified LIME for Sequences</h3>
<p>We used the technique of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938" target="_blank">Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)</a> to add interpretability. LIME can be
applied to almost any type of model, but here we will consider its application to
text data. Put simply, LIME is a way to understand how different parts of an
input affect the output of a model. This is accomplished, essentially, by
turning the dials of the input and observing the effect on the output.</p>
<p>Consider a model that classifies news headlines as “clickbait” or “not
clickbait.” The model could identify individual words as more or less
clickbaity, depending on how they affect the output. If removing a word from the
input generally makes the model predict clickbait, then that word contributes to
the model’s clickbait classification for that particular input.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/fig-24.png" alt="LIME identifies words that contribute to positive or negativeclassification."><figcaption>LIME identifies words that contribute to positive or negative
classification.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This method makes sense for models that process the input as a bag of words, but
what about for models like BERT that process the input as a sequence? These
models don’t view an input as simply a collection of isolated words; they are
capable of picking out statements, sentences, or thoughts. Further, removing
words from the input as a method to understand the model’s predictions makes the
input incoherent.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/fig-25.png" alt="LIME defaults to masking words, which produces a type of incoherent language that sequence models like BERT were not trained on."><figcaption>LIME defaults to masking words, which produces a type of incoherent language that sequence models like BERT were not trained on.</figcaption></figure>
<p>What works well for a bag-of-words model seems unnatural for a sequence model.
One could imagine that BERT works instead by treating input text as compositions
of whole sentences, rather than compositions of words (although this is a
simplification). In this case, it makes more sense to apply LIME at the sentence
level. Removing sentences may still produce incoherent text, but if thoughts are
relatively confined to sentences then this may be an acceptable trade-off.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we applied LIME at the sentence level for the final BERT
model. For the NB-SVM baseline we explored both word- and sentence-level LIME.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/image-line-comparison.png" alt="Left: Word-level interpretability can be overwhelming and difficult to parse.Right: Sentence-level interpretability provides a more concise picture."><figcaption>Left: Word-level interpretability can be overwhelming and difficult to parse.
Right: Sentence-level interpretability provides a more concise picture.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of the model, we found sentence-level LIME easier to digest. When
highlighting individual words there is simply too much information to process.</p>
<h3 id="interpretability-provides-trust">Interpretability Provides Trust</h3>
<p>With a model that can gauge the sentiment of a movie review, we can do some
useful things. For example, we can visualize the overall sentiment of a
particular film. This allows users to quickly gauge popular movies and could be
used as a tool for recommending the best movies.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/frontpage.png" alt="The Textflix dashboard makes it easy to find popular and unpopular movies."><figcaption>The Textflix dashboard makes it easy to find popular and unpopular movies.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Users can drill down to a particular title and read a sampling of its positive
and negative reviews. But model predictions are rarely blindly accepted. Users
who want to verify that the model is doing something sensible may opt to skim
the reviews, looking for evidence of the model’s predictions. This introduces a
significant cognitive burden – reviews are long, but the sentiment may be
expressed in just one sentence. The following review, where most of the text is
simply summarizing the plot, is a good example.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/image-interp-compare.png" alt="Top: The model classifies this review as positive, but with no supporting evidence. Bottom: The model explains its positive classification by highlighting a single sentence, which should be enough to convince users to trust the prediction.

View the review at <a href="https://textflix.fastforwardlabs.com/review?id=46" target="_blank">on Texflix</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without interpretability, a user may need to skim each and every review for
evidence supporting the model’s predictions. But using LIME, we can
automatically point to specific evidence that the model relies on to make its
predictions. In this case, users can immediately see why the model has made a
prediction and trust that it is correct.</p>
<h3 id="interpretability-as-a-summarization-tool">Interpretability as a Summarization Tool</h3>
<p>Interpretability tools that can point to specific evidence in the input to
explain model predictions actually offer a new product opportunity.
Specifically, we found that using LIME to identify highly polarized sentences
allowed us to construct high-level summaries of each movie’s reviews.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/image-highlights.png" alt="By scoring each sentence as positive or negative, interpretability toolsenable summarizations of sentiment for each movie."><figcaption>By scoring each sentence as positive or negative, interpretability tools
enable summarizations of sentiment for each movie.</figcaption></figure>
<p>These summaries give a reader a broad picture of others’ sentiment toward the
movie, without them having to scroll through each of the individual reviews.
Without interpretability, we could only show users entire reviews, which are
burdensome to read. We find interpretability is an essential component of
building interesting data products.</p>
<h2 id="successes-and-failures">Successes and Failures</h2>
<p>Transfer learning using BERT yielded impressive results, especially considering
the limited training data. It was a clear and significant improvement over the
alternatives. But like any model, BERT has its limitations. In this section we
examine some of the concrete successes and failures of the prototype model.</p>
<h3 id="bert-identifies-mixed-feelings">BERT Identifies Mixed Feelings</h3>
<p><img src="figures/image-opposing.png" alt="Interpretability at the sentence level shows how the model balances opposing sentiments within reviews. View the review on Textflix">.</p>
<p>There are many reviews in the dataset that would classify as “easy” in the sense that they communicate clear sentiment using words that are positive or negative. The final deployed BERT model, unsurprisingly, handles these cases well. The passage above demonstrates some of this plain language, but is interesting in that it has individual sentences that communicate opposing sentiments. With the added interpretability mechanism, it is possible to not only show the model’s overall prediction for the sentiment of the review but also its predictions for some of the individual parts. This helps draw attention to reviews that are mixed, where a single sentiment score does not necessarily tell the entire story.</p>
<h3 id="bert-handles-subtle-language-and-negation-well">BERT Handles Subtle Language and Negation Well</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“But Valley Girl is one of the few romance films I could sit through.”<br>
– A review for <em>Valley Girl</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This review text is relatively subtle. It does not contain any explicitly
positive or negative words, yet it is fairly obvious to a human that it conveys
a positive sentiment.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/valley-girl.png" alt="Top: BERT correctly predicts positive sentiment despite the indirect language. Bottom: NB-SVM incorrectly predicts negative sentiment. Neutral words like “romance” and “sit” are associated with positive or negative feelings."><figcaption>Top: BERT correctly predicts positive sentiment despite the indirect language. Bottom: NB-SVM incorrectly predicts negative sentiment. Neutral words like “romance” and “sit” are associated with positive or negative feelings.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The BERT model produces the correct prediction, even if it is not clear how it
infers this. The baseline NB-SVM model, on the other hand, must invoke simple
rules which fail in this case. Using word-level LIME, we can see that the
baseline model associates neutral words like “romance” and “sit” with positive
or negative sentiment, even though these words on their own do not convey
sentiment.</p>
<p>As a test of BERT’s understanding, we can experiment with negating the entire
phrase and observing the new prediction.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/valley-negation.png" alt="Top: BERT correctly flips its prediction when the “not” modifier is used to negate the positive statement. Bottom: NB-SVM does not recognize “not” as a negative word, and does not change its prediction."><figcaption>Top: BERT correctly flips its prediction when the “not” modifier is used to negate the positive statement. Bottom: NB-SVM does not recognize “not” as a negative word, and does not change its prediction.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, BERT now predicts a negative sentiment. The baseline model, however, can
only rely on each word as a small piece of evidence. Even though it sees “not”
as carrying negative sentiment value, the prediction overall is still positive.</p>
<p>There are cases where BERT fails, though, even with simple negation. Although
LIME is a useful tool, it’s not a catch-all. There is still quite some mystery
in terms of how BERT works and when it will fail.</p>
<h3 id="sentiment-can-be-unclear">Sentiment Can Be Unclear</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“In any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie.”<br>
– A positive review for <em>See No Evil</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Average adventure movie that took a serious story and ‘Holywoodised’ it… The screenplay was average. The charm of Connery made up for his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpiece takes.”<br>
– A positive review for <em>The Wind and the Lion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The storyline is okay at best, and the acting is surprisingly alright, but after awhile it’s gets to be a little much. But, still it’s fun, quirky, strange, and original.”<br>
– A positive review for <em>Don’t Look in the Basement</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these examples is from an instance where the BERT model made an
incorrect prediction. Each of them is surprising, even to humans, in some way.
That is, they each express a statement of sentiment that is opposite of the
rating the reviewer gave. This underscores the fact that sentiment analysis is
not really a binary task – in reality, humans may like some things and dislike
others, which makes it somewhat nonsensical to distill their feelings into a
single positive or negative classification. In some cases where the model gets
it wrong, a human might also.</p>
<p>One encouraging aspect of these cases is that the BERT model is often quite
uncertain in its predictions. Models will inevitably make errors, but the
ability to provide a reliable measure of uncertainty makes it easier to use and
trust their outputs.</p>
<h3 id="entity-assignment-presents-a-challenge">Entity Assignment Presents a Challenge</h3>
<figure><img src="figures/showtime-review.png" alt="A review for Showtime where the model is confused by a positive reference to another film."><figcaption>A review for <em>Showtime</em> where the model is confused by a positive reference to another film.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a review for the film <em>Showtime</em>, a comedic cop film featuring Robert De
Niro and Eddie Murphy. The review is quite negative, but features a mention of a
separate movie - <em>Taxi Driver</em> - which the reviewer remarks is a “fine film.”
The BERT model does not recognize that this positive sentiment is actually
attached to a different entity and should therefore be disregarded.</p>
<p>While BERT has been shown to be effective at the task of entity recognition, the
fine-tuned model here was never explicitly taught to do this. In fact, since the
model only has access to the review itself, it really has no way to know that
<em>Taxi Driver</em> is not the subject of this review. However, even if the model were
given the movie title associated with each review, it is unlikely that it would
learn such nuances. This is because it would not have nearly enough examples in
its small training set for it to be able to learn this special case. Even
including more examples might not be sufficient – instead, the training
objective might need to be changed to explicitly ask the model to pick out
entities and assign each of them a sentiment score.</p>
<p>This is an interesting example because it shows that even though transfer
learning models may have the skills to perform particular tasks, they only
invoke those skills if it is important for prediction accuracy during training.
Transfer learning models are powerful, but they still fall far short of human
intuition.</p>
<h2 id="prototype-product-design">Prototype Product Design</h2>
<figure><img src="figures/textflix-screenshot.png" alt="The final Textflix design."><figcaption>The final Textflix design.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We make prototypes to spark our clients’ imaginations about how emerging
technologies could be applied to their own business problems. Besides being
functional, this means our prototypes need to tell a good story. In this section
we’ll discuss the design and storytelling decisions that went into Textflix.</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-the-classification">Visualizing the Classification</h3>
<p>Once we decided to focus on sentiment analysis and use the IMDB review dataset,
the fundamental unit of the prototype was clear: the text of a movie review and
the model’s classification of that review as positive or negative. Presenting
just those elements makes for a functional tech demo, but also a dry one.</p>
<p>The first step we took towards making things more interesting <em>and</em>
understandable was to apply the LIME interpretability technique at the sentence
level. Using LIME, we show the user which sentences were driving the
classification. This makes the classification feel much more dynamic. You can
visualize (a simplified version of) the model’s examination process.</p>
<h3 id="developing-the-story">Developing the Story</h3>
<p>The second thing we did was develop a story about why these reviews needed to be
analyzed. On the dataset side, we grouped reviews under the movie or show they
were reviewing, and selected the groups with the most reviews. Grouping reviews
made it possible to build the prototype as an imaginary movie/show review site.</p>
<p>The IMDB dataset, by design, covers a wide range of movies and shows, so sorting
by the most reviewed gave us a rather eccentric list of entertainments. Part of
the storytelling challenge of these prototypes is explaining dataset limitations
like this one in a non-disruptive way.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/messageboard-screenshot.png" alt="An earlier version of the prototype presented the reviews as part of an entertainment message board."><figcaption>An earlier version of the prototype presented the reviews as part of an entertainment message board.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Originally, we thought about imagining the reviews as part of a message board,
which would help explain both the range of topics and the text-only nature of
the reviews (movie review sites often have a mechanism for directly inputting
user ratings, while message board posts are typically limited to a text box).
Later we realized we didn’t have to be so specific to provide a plausible
explanation for why the selection was so varied. Anyone who subscribes to a
streaming service has seen the odd range of movies and TV shows that can result
from behind-the-scenes license negotiations. We decided our make-believe service
would be called Textflix, and that its weird selection was just a result of the
licenses available.</p>
<h3 id="adding-drama-to-analysis">Adding Drama to Analysis</h3>
<p>Once we had our idea for a fictional streaming site in place, we began working
on showing the value sentiment analysis could bring to the site. Here again we
had to balance the design of a real product with the need for storytelling and a
little bit of drama. We decided that you would be able to turn the sentiment
analysis on and off in the prototype (in a real product there’d be no reason for
the off option). This would help us emphasize, by contrast, the capabilities
text analysis gives you. Without analysis, you must read each review,
one-by-one, to get an idea of the overall sentiment of the reviews. With
analysis you can see the general opinion at a glance. Analysis makes sentiment
computable and sortable, allowing you to answer questions like “what is the most
liked movie?” (an indie drama called <em>What Alice Found</em> in this case).</p>
<p>The minimal design of the prototype emphasizes the new powers analysis gives
you. With analysis off you’re faced with long blocks of text and no color. With
it on, you get green and orange sentiment indicators, underlines, and review
highlights.</p>
<h3 id="a-peek-behind-the-curtain">A Peek Behind the Curtain</h3>
<figure><img src="figures/options-screenshot.png" alt="A movie page with the accuracy and model comparison options turned on. These options would not be appropriate for a consumer-facing product, but we includedthem for their explanatory power."><figcaption>A movie page with the accuracy and model comparison options turned on. These options would not be appropriate for a consumer-facing product, but we included
them for their explanatory power.</figcaption></figure>
<p>With analysis on, Textflix shows the capabilities that text analysis can bring
to a product. We included two further analysis options to give people a closer
look at the algorithm. These would not be included in a consumer-facing product,
but we put them in the prototype for their explanatory power. The first option
is “accuracy.” It shows how well the model’s classifications matched the
review’s original labels. With accuracy on you can see the model’s overall
performance as well as find reviews where the model got things wrong. This
feature is obviously useful but it is only available because we are working with
an example dataset that is fully labeled, something unlikely to happen in real
life (if your real life dataset is fully labeled you don’t need a model to
classify it). The accuracy feature in the prototype, then, is a peek behind the
curtain. It wouldn’t be possible in a real product, but in Textflix, seeing the
errors helps build your intuition about the model’s performance and where it
might tend to get things wrong or right.</p>
<p>The second feature is “model comparison.” When activated, this feature opens a
split-screen view, where our transfer-learning trained model is on the right,
and NB-SVM, our baseline model, is on the left. Seeing their classifications
side-by-side gives you a concrete idea of the gains made through transfer
learning. You can compare the accuracy of both approaches and see reviews where
they disagree. In a final consumer-facing product, you’d want to only expose the
best model (though checking it against a baseline during development is still
very much recommended).</p>
<p>There were more options we could have added, but we wanted this prototype to be
clearly focused on a core set of ideas. Most importantly, we wanted to show the
kinds of capabilities that text analysis could open up for a product. Then we
wanted to provide a view into the model’s accuracy and show it in the context of
a less advanced approach. We hope the final product will be both inspirational
and informative for people working on similar projects.</p>
